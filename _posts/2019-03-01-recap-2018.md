From our [<span class="underline">humble beginnings in
2008</span>](https://blog.null.co.in/first-official-null-meet/) we have
grown leap and bounds. However numbers don't do justice to what null has
achieved. So this year we approached each and every chapter and asked
them to outline what they did in 2018. Anything that they considered
worth sharing is what they discussed and is outlined in the post. We
have budding chapters like Ahmedabad and Bhopal where majority of the
attendee’s are students to mature chapters like Bangalore, Mumbai,
Singapore, Dubai and more where mostly professionals venture. All of
them have taken initiative beyond just organizing meetups to serve as a
knowledge sharing community.

This post will outline what null chapters have done over the entire year
in 2018 and will be celebrating the joy of giving back.

Here is what each of our chapters had to say about what they were up to
(Strictly in Alphabetical order)

# **Ahmedabad**

First of all, we would like to thank all the null core community members
who have approved null ahmedabad to establish it as a chapter. We
consider this as our biggest achievement. We conducted our first puliya
session this year. Within 11 months, 12 events were conducted in which
11 meets and 1 public puliya session. Out of 46 sessions, 23 unique
speakers presented. Apart from the regular events:

1.  Jaimin Gohel and Bhashit Pandya conducted multiple CTF challenges
    post meet-ups.

2.  We supported defcon dehradun conducting an online session.

3.  Unique hands-on workshop on lock picking and hardware hacking was
    conducted by Namrata Brahmkshatriya and Ravi Rajput Respectively.

4.  Null Ahmedabad also participated in Kaspersky CTF.

5.  Starting from the handful of people, we reached 60 on 60
    registration.

6.  Few students and people from non-security background came up and
    presented like Sanjay Makwana, Parth Jankhariya, Chinmay Patel,
    Kuldeep Pandya, Bhuvan Gandhi, Vishal Patel and Manju Chufal.

7.  It was absolute privilege to have Amish Patadiya, Savan Gadhiya,
    Sanjay Gondaliya and Darshan Raghwani as speakers of null Ahmedabad
    for multiple meets and our 1st Puliya conducted by Kartik Lalan.

It is all the joint efforts of the team and supporters. 2018 has been a
year of learning but it is just the beginning. Cheers\!

# **Amsterdam**

*Amsterdam Chapter conducted a total of 4 MeetUps in 2018. A total of
114 attendees RSVPd.*

# Bangalore: Null / OWASP / G4H

This year Null Bangalore Chapter organized 25 different events of which
12 were the regular meets, 10 were the Null Humla Sessions, 1 Workshop ,
1 Puliya Session and 1 Special Null Meet on Digital Identity and
Privacy, 1 Public Puliya session, all of these spanning across multiple

This year we also introduced a new session format of QUIZ into the
regular Null Meets. The Quiz Session was recently taken up during the
Jan 2019 Winja Public Puliya Meet. The session turned out to be really
interactive with the maximum audience participation as the questions
asked during the Quiz Session sparked interesting discussion on various
topics in Security such as SCADA, Malware Analysis, Application
Security, IoT Security and other recent happenings in the Security
Industry.

  - This year Null Bangalore celebrated its 9th Anniversary. The event
    got one of the highest registrations for Null Bangalore with
    [<span class="underline">164

# Mumbai

As our community is growing bigger day by day, being a open security
community we are trying to maintain the quality of content high along
with passing sense of responsibilities to the participants to contribute
back to the community.

We have hosted total 20 Event(63 Sessions) this year which includes 12
Open monthly meets, 2 Humla hands-on sessions, 3 Puliya session and 3
security workshops.

We witnessed diverse participation from industry professionals, academic
institutes, government agencies and independent consultants. We have
also witnessed the participation from corporates for providing the venue
and required resources for hosting the open security meets and hands-on
session. Few of the companies even went ahead and mandated the
participation to our community for their employees to gain the knowledge
as well as giving back the knowledge.

This year we attempted to bridge the skills gaps which industry is
facing by introducing industry professionals to our community and at the
same time by introducing the college students to such professionals for
any internship or full time opportunities. We have many student
participants which got internship or got permanently placed at reputed
organisations.

We tried covering the diverse security topics this year including
[<span class="underline">Python

We also had talks specific to people getting into or preparing for certs
like
[<span class="underline">OSCP</span>](https://null.co.in/event_sessions/1865-oscp-101)/[<span class="underline">OSCE</span>](https://null.co.in/event_sessions/2183-basic-2-advanced-shellcode-techniques)
where attendees learned from the experiences of speakers. Similar to
Bangalore chapter we had a WINJA meet in first week of January 2019
which had a great turnout, interactive quizzes and CTF. Looking into the
next year we plan on having multiple Puliya sessions based on the
response from the community and CTFs to correlate with sessions.

# Singapore

Null Singapore Chapter is currently the largest security community in
Singapore with over 1600 members. We have organized 4 meetup and 3
workshop events in 2018. At Null Singapore, we have interesting
participation from members with wide rage of expertise including
developers, pentest, hardware security, crypto experts, product
security, network security operations, and more. We are pleased to host
null community booths in well known conferences here such as Blackhat
and HITBGSEC and spread the awareness about our activities.

We have amazing support from the local companies in Singapore to host
our event. In 2018, most of our events were hosted at Grab, Zendesk, and
Cloudflare.

# Way Forward

It's inspiring to see how all these chapters have been working
tirelessly towards the propagation of knowledge and bringing awareness
about information security at grass roots. Each chapter has done
something different to connect with the local community. The testament
to the efforts is the event archive page which is arguably one of the
largest information security archive with base in india :
[<span class="underline">https://null.co.in/event\_sessions</span>](https://null.co.in/event_sessions).
One can pick any topic under the sun on information security and can
find at least one session that was delivered at a null chapter.

The way forward for the community is to keep surpassing our own
achievements and reach new heights, there are hundreds of unexplored
possibilities and scenarios which will only be possible when people join
hands. So this blog post should also be considered as a request to step
forward and suggest what more we can do to help the world be a better
place.

Please reach out to your respective chapter leaders or the null
community managers for any feedback.
